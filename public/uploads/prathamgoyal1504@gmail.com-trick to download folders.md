1. don't use idm or any download managers. you'll get temporarily blocked or maybe permanently in worst case.
2. don't mass download. again same consequences as the first one.
3. don't try using bots or automated scripts or I'll find you and kill you and your family.

4. add ".mp4" extension after downloading the files. files greater than 1MB are video files. this is the noobest way I could explain.
